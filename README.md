# PazzwordAPI
PazzwordAPI is my API I use for all private Bukkit plugins I make for people. (None of my public plugins use this API)

This plugin eases development and shortens the necessary time for me to add redundant features that I've written into dozens of plugins,
many times.

These features include:
<ul>
  <li>User management (Player-like class with extra methods and fields)</li>
  <li>Attachment of special data types to Users</li>
  <li>Cross-plugin sharing of User data</li>
  <li>Data storage (as YAML)</li>
  <li>Special handlers interface for loading/saving data for Users</li>
  <li>User management (Player-like class with extra methods and fields)</li>
  <li>Static classes that handle mundane activities (comparing objects [ItemStacks, Locations], serializing special data types, etc)</li>
</ul>
